# spwn-letters
A 6 letter spelling simulator thing made in Geometry Dash.  
My very first project using [Spwn](https://github.com/Spu7Nix/SPWN-language) scripting.

This project is quite unstable at times and can break under many circumstances.

# Known Bugs
- Spamming either of the action keys will cause letter pileups and row misalignment.  
- Sometimes when you move a row over, the letters will continue off from the last row, this is solved by simply slowing down your inputs  
- The selector arrow can go out of bounds, seemingly at random
